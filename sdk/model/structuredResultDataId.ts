/**
 * LUSID API
 * # Introduction  This page documents the [LUSID APIs](https://www.lusid.com/api/swagger), which allows authorised clients to query and update their data within the LUSID platform.  SDKs to interact with the LUSID APIs are available in the following languages and frameworks:  * [C#](https://github.com/finbourne/lusid-sdk-csharp) * [Java](https://github.com/finbourne/lusid-sdk-java) * [JavaScript](https://github.com/finbourne/lusid-sdk-js) * [Python](https://github.com/finbourne/lusid-sdk-python) * [Angular](https://github.com/finbourne/lusid-sdk-angular)  The LUSID platform is made up of a number of sub-applications. You can find the API / swagger documentation by following the links in the table below.   | Application | Description | API / Swagger Documentation | | ----- | ----- | ---- | | LUSID | Open, API-first, developer-friendly investment data platform. | [Swagger](https://www.lusid.com/api/swagger/index.html) | | Web app | User-facing front end for LUSID. | [Swagger](https://www.lusid.com/app/swagger/index.html) | | Scheduler | Automated job scheduler. | [Swagger](https://www.lusid.com/scheduler2/swagger/index.html) | | Insights |Monitoring and troubleshooting service. | [Swagger](https://www.lusid.com/insights/swagger/index.html) | | Identity | Identity management for LUSID (in conjuction with Access) | [Swagger](https://www.lusid.com/identity/swagger/index.html) | | Access | Access control for LUSID (in conjunction with Identity) | [Swagger](https://www.lusid.com/access/swagger/index.html) | | Drive | Secure file repository and manager for collaboration. | [Swagger](https://www.lusid.com/drive/swagger/index.html) | | Luminesce | Data virtualisation service (query data from multiple providers, including LUSID) | [Swagger](https://www.lusid.com/honeycomb/swagger/index.html) | | Notification | Notification service. | [Swagger](https://www.lusid.com/notifications/swagger/index.html) | | Configuration | File store for secrets and other sensitive information. | [Swagger](https://www.lusid.com/configuration/swagger/index.html) |
