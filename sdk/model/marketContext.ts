/**
 * LUSID API
 * # Introduction  This page documents the [LUSID APIs](https://www.lusid.com/api/swagger), which allows authorised clients to query and update their data within the LUSID platform.  SDKs to interact with the LUSID APIs are available in the following languages and frameworks:  * [C#](https://github.com/finbourne/lusid-sdk-csharp) * [Java](https://github.com/finbourne/lusid-sdk-java) * [JavaScript](https://github.com/finbourne/lusid-sdk-js) * [Python](https://github.com/finbourne/lusid-sdk-python) * [Angular](https://github.com/finbourne/lusid-sdk-angular)  The LUSID platform is made up of a number of sub-applications. You can find the API / swagger documentation by following the links in the table below.   | Application | Description | API / Swagger Documentation | | ----- | ----- | ---- | | LUSID | Open, API-first, developer-friendly investment data platform. | [Swagger](https://www.lusid.com/api/swagger/index.html) | | Web app | User-facing front end for LUSID. | [Swagger](https://www.lusid.com/app/swagger/index.html) | | Scheduler | Automated job scheduler. | [Swagger](https://www.lusid.com/scheduler2/swagger/index.html) | | Insights |Monitoring and troubleshooting service. | [Swagger](https://www.lusid.com/insights/swagger/index.html) | | Identity | Identity management for LUSID (in conjuction with Access) | [Swagger](https://www.lusid.com/identity/swagger/index.html) | | Access | Access control for LUSID (in conjunction with Identity) | [Swagger](https://www.lusid.com/access/swagger/index.html) | | Drive | Secure file repository and manager for collaboration. | [Swagger](https://www.lusid.com/drive/swagger/index.html) | | Luminesce | Data virtualisation service (query data from multiple providers, including LUSID) | [Swagger](https://www.lusid.com/honeycomb/swagger/index.html) | | Notification | Notification service. | [Swagger](https://www.lusid.com/notifications/swagger/index.html) | | Configuration | File store for secrets and other sensitive information. | [Swagger](https://www.lusid.com/configuration/swagger/index.html) |

* Market context node. This defines how LUSID processes parts of a request that require resolution of market data such as instrument prices or  Fx rates. It controls where the data is loaded from and which sources take precedence.

    * The set of rules that define how to resolve particular use cases. These can be relatively general or specific in nature.  Nominally any number are possible and will be processed in order where applicable. However, there is evidently a potential  for increased computational cost where many rules must be applied to resolve data. Ensuring that portfolios are structured in  such a way as to reduce the number of rules required is therefore sensible.
