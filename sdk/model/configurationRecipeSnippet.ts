/**
 * LUSID API
 * # Introduction  This page documents the [LUSID APIs](https://www.lusid.com/api/swagger), which allows authorised clients to query and update their data within the LUSID platform.  SDKs to interact with the LUSID APIs are available in the following languages and frameworks:  * [C#](https://github.com/finbourne/lusid-sdk-csharp) * [Java](https://github.com/finbourne/lusid-sdk-java) * [JavaScript](https://github.com/finbourne/lusid-sdk-js) * [Python](https://github.com/finbourne/lusid-sdk-python) * [Angular](https://github.com/finbourne/lusid-sdk-angular)  The LUSID platform is made up of a number of sub-applications. You can find the API / swagger documentation by following the links in the table below.   | Application | Description | API / Swagger Documentation | | ----- | ----- | ---- | | LUSID | Open, API-first, developer-friendly investment data platform. | [Swagger](https://www.lusid.com/api/swagger/index.html) | | Web app | User-facing front end for LUSID. | [Swagger](https://www.lusid.com/app/swagger/index.html) | | Scheduler | Automated job scheduler. | [Swagger](https://www.lusid.com/scheduler2/swagger/index.html) | | Insights |Monitoring and troubleshooting service. | [Swagger](https://www.lusid.com/insights/swagger/index.html) | | Identity | Identity management for LUSID (in conjuction with Access) | [Swagger](https://www.lusid.com/identity/swagger/index.html) | | Access | Access control for LUSID (in conjunction with Identity) | [Swagger](https://www.lusid.com/access/swagger/index.html) | | Drive | Secure file repository and manager for collaboration. | [Swagger](https://www.lusid.com/drive/swagger/index.html) | | Luminesce | Data virtualisation service (query data from multiple providers, including LUSID) | [Swagger](https://www.lusid.com/honeycomb/swagger/index.html) | | Notification | Notification service. | [Swagger](https://www.lusid.com/notifications/swagger/index.html) | | Configuration | File store for secrets and other sensitive information. | [Swagger](https://www.lusid.com/configuration/swagger/index.html) |

/**
* If it is desired to have multiple recipes, there is a strong likelihood that they will share various components.  A configuration recipe snippet allows a user to define a set of rules that can then be included into a parent recipe.  This allows sharing of common blocks of the recipe.                For example, a user might define a set of rules for resolving Fx and then include them into every recipe used firm-wide, thereby  enforcing consistency. As the rules can be permissioned differently using Shrine, it is possible to enable users to   read but not alter such a rule set.                The same applies to a set of pricing rules.                A configuration snippet must only contain one entry from the available set.                 Recipes are compiled from the set of snippets through a model that is analogous to inheritance.  A recipe can have a set of \'parent\' recipes from which it inherits. These are specified in the inheritance section of a recipe.  Upon loading, the recipe will fall back on these recipe components for any options or rules that are not explicitly specified in the  named recipe for the request.                This allows control of pricing to be harmonised across a set of desks within an institution. Suppose that, e.g.  there are four desks looking after products under the areas of Fx, Rates, Credit and Exotics.  The model and market data for pricing given asset types would potentially be controlled by the appropriate desk; e.g. rules for Fx market data resolution being  controlled by the Fx desk. The exotics desk would likely depend upon rules for all the other asset classes as well as, say, correlation rules of its own.  It could inherit the market data and model rules from the other desks for finding the appropriate institution-standard data and then overlay that with the correlation rules.                Note that permissioning of the store means that one could decide that only a particular desk or control function could update certain rules. That would assist the abilitiy  to ensure that pricing is performed consistently and provide an audit of changes made to it along with restricting changes to appropriate authorised functions.

Ensuring that portfolios are structured in  such a way as to reduce the number of rules required is therefore sensible.
