* An item of structured market data that is to be inserted into Lusid. This will typically be a Json or Xml document that  contains a set of market quotes (tradables) that can be used to construct a composite view of a market property such as the  interest rates over time; commonly referred to as an interest rate, projection or discount curve. Other examples include  volatility surfaces and credit spread curves.
